Please use this template to spread facts in real life.

This project's aim is to expose the government's corruption.  

This is a decentralised office. Anyone can work here. We want to cover the real world with facts to awaken people. 

Stick them on newspapers, stick them on walls, bollards, in the local supermarket, wherever you can. Give them to everyone. 

If you are using the template, please check and double check your research to ensure what you have written is a fact no one can argue with.

Greedy people use ideology to hide what they really care about, money and power. The last thing they want is for people to point out what they are trying to hide and distract from, and for this information to be everywhere, outside of government or media control.

Cut through all the noise and make the truth obvious. 

If truth wasn't powerful, there wouldn't be so much effort made to present things in a certain way.
