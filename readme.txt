Please use this template to spread facts in real life. 

These stickers can be printed at home on cheap label paper from any stationary shop or pound shop. 

If you want to stick to the formatting, use Arial and make the letter spacing lower. But if you do not have the skills to do this, the formatting is not really important. 

This project's aim is to expose the government's corruption.  

This is a decentralised office. Anyone can work here. We want to cover the real world with facts to awaken people. 

Stick them on newspapers, stick them on walls, bollards, in the local supermarket, wherever you can. Give them to everyone. 

Make stickers containing any information that you think people need to know. For example, if a business supports genocide, use their logo with a short, clear sentence that explains what they do. Or if a politician has done something out of self interest. The idea is to add to the pressure, especially by using facts about money. If you think a certain email address needs to receive a lot of complaints, include it. 

All causes of social liberation help each other, so if you are passionate about local causes like rising homelessness, caused by
greed, you should feel free to spread the word with these stickers. It's especially good if you can keep to a fact about individuals or companies profiting from doing bad things to people. Systems are all made up of individual people, and they can be fought by spreading awareness and making things clear, so that when individuals are asked to do something they think is wrong, they know for sure and can refuse. 

If you are using the template, please check and double check your research to ensure what you have written is a fact no one can argue with.

Greedy people use ideology to hide what they really care about, money and power. The last thing they want is for people to point out what they are trying to hide and distract from, and for this information to be everywhere, outside of government or media control. 

We demand an end to genocide and ceasefire. 

We also demand honesty and service from the people in government. 

Right now, they can't be trusted to give us information that is not spin and propaganda. So we must do their job for them and show them how it is done. 

Cut through all the noise and make the truth obvious. 

If truth wasn't powerful, there wouldn't be so much effort made to present things in a certain way.
